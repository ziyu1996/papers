# Introduction 

BBOA are important fpr the radiative effect but the magnitude and even direction are unclear.see Haywood et al (2000).
Our measurement set out to add to this body of knowledge using Mass Spectrometer data (Allan etal 2001).

Ziyu is a wonderful and perfect person!


# Simulations

John's box model is consistent with coagulation as teh dominant growth mechanism.

#Methodology

We used a ToF-AMS to measure aerosol mass and composition
